# Simple Patching to Existing Oracle Home

## Introduction

In this lab, you will patch another Oracle Database using AutoUpgrade. Since you have already created a new Oracle home, you will use that. There is no need to create a separate Oracle home each database. 

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Assess the patch readiness of a database
* Patch a database

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes:

- You have completed Lab 3: Simple Patching With AutoUpgrade

## Task 1: Analyze database

You will use AutoUpgrade just like in lab 3. 

1. Use the *yellow* terminal ðŸŸ¨. In this lab, you use a pre-created config file. Examine the config file.

    ```
    <copy>
    cd
    cat scripts/simple-patching-existing-home.cfg
    </copy>

    -- Be sure to hit RETURN
    ```

    * This config file is much simpler than the previous one from lab 3.
    * Since the Oracle home exists, the patch process becomes easier.

    ``` text
    $ cat scripts/simple-patching-existing-home.cfg
    global.autoupg_log_dir=/home/oracle/autoupgrade-patching/simple-patching-existing-home/log
    patch1.source_home=/u01/app/oracle/product/19
    patch1.target_home=/u01/app/oracle/product/19_25
    patch1.sid=UPGR
    ```
    </details>    

2. Analyze the database.

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config scripts/simple-patching-existing-home.cfg -mode analyze
    </copy>
    ```

    * Since you don't need to build a new Oracle home, you need to omit the `-patch` parameter from the command line.
    * Otherwise, you use the same commands as in lab 3.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
UPDATEUPDATE
    ```
    </details>    

3. Wait a minute or two until AutoUpgrade completes. Don't exit from the AutoUpgrade console. 

4. When the job completes, AutoUpgrade prints the location of the *summary report* which contains detailed information about the analysis. Check the summary report.

    ```
    <copy>
    cat /home/oracle/autoupgrade-patching/simple-patching-existing-home/log/cfgtoollogs/patch/auto/status/status.log
    </copy>
    ```

    * You can see that you're patching the UPGR database. 
    * You can also see that you're patching from 19.21 to 19.25.
    * In the end, you can see that all checks passed and there's no manual intervention needed.
    * This database was found to be ready for patching. 

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    UPDATEUPDATE    
    ```
    </details>   

## Task 2: Patch database

Patching a single instance Oracle Database require downtime. Downtime starts now.

1. Start patching the database. 

    ```
    <copy>
    java -jar autoupgrade.jar -config scripts/simple-patching-existing-home.cfg -mode deploy
    </copy>
    ```

    * You're reusing the same command line as the analysis, however, this time you are activating deploy mode.
    * Deploy mode is the complete automation which performs all parts of a patch process. 

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
UPDATEUPDATE
    ```
    </details>    

2. Monitor the progress.

    ```
    <copy>
    lsj -a 10
    </copy>
    ```

    * The `lsj` command lists active jobs. 
    * The `-a 10` parameter refreshes the information every 10 seconds.

    <details>
    <summary>*click to see the output*</summary>
    ``` text
    lsj -a 10
    patch> +----+-------+---------+---------+-------+----------+-------+----------------+
    |Job#|DB_NAME|    STAGE|OPERATION| STATUS|START_TIME|UPDATED|         MESSAGE|
    +----+-------+---------+---------+-------+----------+-------+----------------+
    | 101|   FTEX|PRECHECKS|EXECUTING|RUNNING|  10:10:12|12s ago|Executing Checks|
    +----+-------+---------+---------+-------+----------+-------+----------------+
    Total jobs 1
    
    The command lsj is running every 10 seconds. PRESS ENTER TO EXIT
    ```
    </details>        

3. It takes just a few minutes to patch the database. Leave AutoUpgrade running.

    * Optionally, switch to the *blue* ðŸŸ¦ terminal and examine the log files.
    * Or, you can use the `status -job 101 -a 10` command.

4. When patching completes, AutoUpgrade exists.    

5. Update the profile script. Since the database now runs out of a new Oracle home, you must update the profile script. This command replaces the `ORACLE_HOME` variable in the profile script.

    ```
    <copy>
    sed -i 's/^ORACLE_HOME=.*/ORACLE_HOME=\/u01\/app\/oracle\/product\/19_25/' /usr/local/bin/upgr
    </copy>
    ``` 

11. That's it. You just patched your Oracle Database including:
    * Using an existing Oracle home
    * Required and recommended pre- and post-tasks
    * Copying database configuration files from old to new Oracle home
    * Restarting database in new Oracle home
    * Executing Datapatch

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
